# CastHelloVideo-ios

This Google Cast demo app shows how an iOS sender app can cast a Video. For simplicity this app is not fully compliant with the UX Checklist.

**The project contains targets for both Objective-C and Swift.**

## Dependencies
* CocoaPods - dependencies are managed via CocoaPods. See http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html for setup instructions.
* Alternatively, you may download the iOS Sender API library directly at: [https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers#ios](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers#ios "iOS Sender API library")

## Setup Instructions
1. Get a Google Cast device and get it set up for development: https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers#setup_for_development.
1. [Optional] Register an application on the Developers Console [http://cast.google.com/publish](http://cast.google.com/publish "Google Cast Developer Console").
  You will get an App ID when you finish registering your application. This project uses a published Application ID that
  can be used to run the app without using your own ID but if you need to do any console debugging, you would need to
  have your own ID.
    * **If you use DRM, you will need to use your own App ID.**
1. Setup the project dependencies in Xcode using Cocoapods, installing the tool if necessary: See this [guide](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
1. In the root folder, run `pod repo update` and then `pod install`.
1. Open the .xcworkspace file rather the the xcproject to ensure you have the pod dependencies.
1. The `AppDelegate.swift`/`AppDelegate.m` includes a published receiver App ID so the project can be built and run without a need
  to register an ID.
    * **Update this value with your own App ID to use your own receiver to debug and use DRM.**
1. The `Info.plist` lists the published receiver App ID for `NSBonjourServices` which is used to discover Cast devices.
    * **Update this value with your own App ID if you are using a custom receiver.**
1. For additional setup steps, see the [Xcode setup guide](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender_setup#xcode_setup).
