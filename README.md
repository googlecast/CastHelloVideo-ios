# hello-cast-video-ios

This Hello Video demo application shows how an iOS sender application can cast a Video.  For simplicity this app is not fully compliant with the UX Checklist. 

## Dependencies
* iOS Sender API library : can be downloaded here at: [https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers#ios](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers#ios "iOS Sender API library")

## Setup Instructions
* Get a Chromecast device and get it set up for development: https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers#Get_started
* Register an application on the Developers Console [http://cast.google.com/publish](http://cast.google.com/publish "Google Cast Developer Console"). The easiest would be to use the Styled Media Receiver option there. You will get an App ID when you finish registering your application.
* Setup the project dependencies in xCode
* In HGCVViewController.m, replace @"YOUR\_APP\_ID\_HERE" with your app identifier from the Google Cast Developer Console. When you are done, it will look something like: 
  * static NSString *const kReceiverAppID = @"1234ABCD";
